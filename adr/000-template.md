#### **000: Title here**
<!--  
*A short, human-readable summary of the architectural decision.*  
☑ Keep it under ~50 chars.  
☑ Use imperative mood (“Adopt PostgreSQL for…”, “Introduce CQRS for…”).  
☑ Avoid jargon an outsider wouldn’t understand.  
-->

**Status:**
<!--  
- 📝 **RFC** – under discussion, not binding.
- 🚧 **Proposed** – under discussion, not binding.  
- ✅ **Accepted** – agreed and in effect.  
- 🔄 **Superseded** – replaced by a newer ADR (link it).  
- ❌ **Rejected** – considered but not adopted.  
- 🗑️ **Deprecated** – was accepted but no longer recommended.  
Include the decision date (YYYY-MM-DD).

#### **Context**
*Why are we making this decision?*  
<!--  
☑ Describe the business/technical forces, constraints, and goals.  
☑ Summarize relevant background and “problem statement”.  
☑ List key stakeholders and drivers.  
☑ Reference any prior ADRs, tickets, research, benchmarks, or PoCs.  
☑ Keep to facts; avoid proposing a solution here.  
-->

#### **Decision**
*What option have we chosen and why?*  
<!--  
☑ State the selected option unambiguously.  
☑ Explain the rationale—why this option beats the reasonable alternatives.  
☑ Mention rejected alternatives with a one-line reason each.  
☑ Include diagrams, tables, or links if they clarify the choice.  
☑ Reference principles/policies that influenced the decision (e.g. “12-Factor”, “Secure by Design”).  
-->

#### **Consequences**
*What happens because of this decision?*  
<!--  
☑ Positive outcomes (benefits gained).  
☑ Negative trade-offs (costs, risks, limitations).  
☑ Impact on performance, scalability, security, operability, UX, budget, timeline, team skillset.  
☑ Migration or deprecation strategy if applicable.  
-->

#### **Governance**
*How will we steward, review, and evolve this decision?*  
<!--  
☑ Owner / accountable role (e.g. “Platform Tech Lead”).  
☑ Decision review cadence (e.g. “evaluate every 6 months or upon major release”).  
☑ Metrics or KPIs that indicate success/failure.  
☑ Change-control process: who approves amendments or reversal.  
☑ Link to lightweight RFC process or change-request template if one exists.  
-->

#### **Notes**
*Free-form additions.*  
<!--  
☑ Meeting minutes, whiteboard photos, slack threads.  
☑ Open questions or follow-ups.  
☑ Pointers to implementation PRs once work begins.  
☑ Anything useful that doesn’t fit other sections.
