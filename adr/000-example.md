#### **Context**
We need to simplify how we store customer survey responses. The data
currently resides in a relational store, and its rigid schema requirements
have become challenging as we evolve the surveys (for example, introducing
different or extended surveys for our premium customers).

There are various options available to us, like the JSONB data type in
PostgreSQL or document stores such as MongoDB.

‚òë Reference any prior ADRs, tickets, research, benchmarks, or PoCs.  
‚òë Keep to facts; avoid proposing a solution here.  
-->

#### **Decision**
We will use a document database for the customer survey.
The marketing department requires a faster, more flexible way to make changes
to the customer surveys.

Moving to a document database will provide better flexibility and speed, and will
etter facilitate changes by simplifying the customer survey user interface.

‚òë State the selected option unambiguously.  
‚òë Explain the rationale‚Äîwhy this option beats the reasonable alternatives.  
‚òë Mention rejected alternatives with a one-line reason each.  
‚òë Include diagrams, tables, or links if they clarify the choice.  
‚òë Reference principles/policies that influenced the decision (e.g. ‚Äú12-Factor‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecure by Design‚Äù).  
-->

#### **Consequences**
Since we will be using a single representation for all surveys, multiple documents
will need to be changed when a common survey question is updated, added, or
removed.

The IT team will need to shut down survey functionality during the data migration
rom the relational database to the document datahase
